# Analysis of NYC Citi Bike Data

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight on how Citi bike is used in NYC and to come up with a proposal for investors that may be interested in helping fund a bike sharing business in Des Moines. Given how succesful Citi bike is in NYC, by analyzing the data, we can duplicate based on the data interpreted on how and what to focus on, in order to start a successful bike sharing business. Below are some charts created to analzye the data. I have also included a link to my Tableau public [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/MYRPXS6F9?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) where the following charts can be found.


1. Checkout Time for User

The graph is organized so that the y-axis is labeled as number of bikes checked out and the x-axis serves as trip duration. The image above shows the checkout time for users. The majority of checkout times for users are bewteen 4.5-6.5 hours and starts to taper off after the 6.5 hour mark. 

2. Check Out Time by Gender

The graph is organized so that checkout bikes are on the y-axis and the x-axis is divided by hours and minutes. The image above presents checkout data depndendent on gender. The yellow line represents male, while the blue line represents female. Lastly, the red line respresents gender unknown. It is clear from our chart that males check bikes out a lot more than females and unknown genders. 

3. Trips by Weekday

The graph is organized so that the y-axis is organized by hours and the x-axis is labeled by weekdays. The darker shades on the graph represents more trips while the lighter shades represents less trips taken. From the chart, you can see that the busiest times were on weekdays during the hours of 5PM-7PM. 

4. Trips by Gender

The graph is organized so that the y-axis is labeled by hours and the x-axis is by gender as well as weekday. Here we can see that males are checking bikes out more during late afternoon around 5PM-7PM. But data shows similar results amongst women and men in the morning around 7AM-9AM seeing more activity. 

5. User Trips by Gender

This graph is organized so that we are seeing data on subscribers of the service and customers through a week and is cross referenced by gender. Unknown gender is represented as 0, male as 1, and female as 2 in this chart. The data clearly shows that there are more subscribers than one off customers and that would makes sense because subscribers are more inclined to use the service as they are paying recurring fees. The most usage of bikes are from males and vary from weekdays. The darkest shade indicates that Thursday and Friday are the when most males are using bikes. 

6. Top Starting Locations

This chart shows where the hottest spots in the city where users are starting their bike journey from. The darkest shades indicates more activity while lighter and smaller size circles indicates the opposite. This is helpful to analzying and determining where to put more bikes and what locations may need more upkeep due to the amount of traffic it receives. 

7. Average Duration by Age

This chart shows the average ride by time by age. It is clear that younger riders tend to use bikes for longer than people that are older. This gives us insight as to the demographic that can be the main focus to gain a base customer.

## Summary
In summary, there are more subscriber users than customer users. There are many factors that should be taken into account when making informed decisions on whether or not a bike sharing business would thrive in Des Moines. Understanding factors such as gender, location, and demand can influence on what decisions should be made and waht should be avoided. From our analysis of the data, males were more dominant in the data we examined, especially during Thursday and Fridays. There were more activity concentrated in the busier parts of the city and that men were more likely to check bikes out for longer.
