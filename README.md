This graph is organized so that we are seeing data on subscribers of the service and customers through a week and is cross referenced by gender. Unknown gender is represented as 0, male as 1, and female as 2 in this chart. The data clearly shows that there are more subscribers than one off customers and that would makes sense because subscribers are more inclined to use the service as they are paying recurring fees. The most usage of bikes are from males and vary from weekdays. The darkest shade indicates that Thursday and Friday are the when most males are using bikes.
